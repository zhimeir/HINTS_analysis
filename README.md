# HINTS_analysis
The repository contains the code to reproduce the statistical analysis in the paper 
*Using multivariate models to examine the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and gender differences on health and health care*.
The analysis is based on the HINTS data publicly available at https://hints.cancer.gov/.
To reproduce the code, one should download the data and put the file named "hints5_cycle4_public.sas7bdat" under the 
directory "code/". 

- The "/code/" folder contains the code to implement the analysis in the paper. "Demographics.R" produces Table 1;
"fit_multivariate_models.R" produces Table 2-4; "make_figures.R" produces the figures. The bash file "run-all.sh"
runs all the three R scripts, and can be executed in the ternimal as :
`bash run-all.sh`
Note that the above should be done under the "/code/" directory.

- The "/results/" folder stores the tables generated by the code.

- The "/figs/" folder stores the figures generated by the code.

## Dependencies
To run the Rscript, the following packages are needed:

- tidyverse(https://www.tidyverse.org/)
- haven(https://haven.tidyverse.org/)
- multicomp(https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/multcomp/index.html)
